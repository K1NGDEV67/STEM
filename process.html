        <h2 id="analysis">Experiment Process:</h2>
        <p> The experiment was a long and hard process and we made many mistakes. We were the second slowest group and we were very pressured especially towards the end because while all the other groups were making their slides, we were still doing the experiment. </p>
        <p> I think our main problem was that we didn't account for all of the different problems we would face such as, 1, not accounting for the surprisingly HUGE amount of time it took to actually cool (taking longer than the lesson), 2, not accounting for the amount of heat loss being related to the size of the cup opening as well as the room temperature, and 3, being forced to restart because the water or equipment spilled / broke respectively, although this happened rarely. </p>
        <p> Because we took such a long time doing the experiment, I think we were forced to have less time on actually building the physcial poster and writing the content, which made me and Aiden, one of our team mates, meet up in the weekends to do some additional writing. </p>
        <p> Additionally, I personally thought that not all of our team members were devoted enough in doing this project and namely 2 of our 4 members were very silly and played a lot of games during the experiment which caused the stress of the 2 other team mates. </p>
        <p> Overall, I think we did a good job, but we could have done better if we had more time to prepare and plan out the experiment. For next time, I wish we all took the process a bit more seriously. </p>
