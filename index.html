        <h1>Research Question</h1>
        <p>Which type of cup will warm a hot cup of tap water for the longest duration: paper, plastic, styrofoam, ceramic, or glass?</p>

        <h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aluminum Foil:</strong> Used as a lid to equalize air loss across cups.</li>
            <li><strong>Thermometer:</strong> Measured temperature in each cup accurately.</li>
            <li><strong>Measuring Cylinder:</strong> Measured 100ml of water per cup.</li>
            <li><strong>Retort Stand:</strong> Held thermometer in place safely.</li>
            <li><strong>Funnel:</strong> Helped pour water into cups with aluminum lids.</li>
            <li><strong>Timer:</strong> Tracked temperature drop from 65°C to 39°C.</li>
